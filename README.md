GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
===================================

In order to get the script run_analysis.R running properly, the data must be unzipped in the working directory with the same tree structure that in the .zip file.

The script will produce two files:
* data.csv: a .csv file containing the merged training and test data and with only the mean and std features.
* data\_step\_5.txt: a text file containing the tidy data set required for step 5.
